# TTGO-SIM7000G-TRACCAR
Guide to connecto lilygo TTGO SIM7000G to Traccar Platform (open source Tracking and position platfom for vehicles)

## 1. Introduction
This project consists of linking the popular LILYGO SIM7000G cards to the Traccar Platform. The 7000G Modem has GSM/GPRS NBIOT and LTEM communication, in addition to having an integrated GPS modem, which makes it a perfect solution to develop solutions that involve real-time geopositioning.
The language used is ARDUINO and I use the TINYGSM library https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/tree/master
The functionalities consist of the following:
- Sending geographical coordinates
- Remote reading of a digital Pin
- Remote writing to a Digital pin
- Configurable data sending frequency

*Note: The functionalities can extend to different conveniences such as reading RS485 sensors, reading analog channels, temperature sensors, humidity, etc.
